-- | A serial number that can be used to match (or ignore as
-- irrelevant) asynchronous events to current application state.

-- Use the 'Eq' and 'Ord' instances to compare generations.  The
-- constructor is hidden; use 'firstGeneration' as the first
-- generation, and use 'nextGeneration' to monotonically increment
-- it.

-- | Purebred event type.  In the future we can abstract this over
-- a custom event type to allow plugins to define their own events.
-- But I've YAGNI'd it for now because it will require an event
-- type parameter on 'AppState', which will be a noisy change.
