# Contributing

At this early stage we're going a bit fast and loose. There are
currently no processes involving contributions. If in doubt, create an issue.

If you'd like to hack on purebred, either pick an issue from the backlog and
signal with a comment that you'd want to work on it. Most of the issues are very
high level and need clarification when it comes to implementation details. So
communication is the key here rather than hacking away.

## Hacking guidelines for purebred

- do not use hs-notmuch message methods that open file descriptors

- optics are your friend

- use `view`, `review`, `set`, `over` and so on instead of the
  infix optic functions from lens

- use explicit import list or qualified imports

- no perf optimisations without measurements (preferably in the commit
  message)

- use the weakest abstraction possible:
  - traverse > mapM
  - pure > return
  - ``Data.Semigroup.<>`` > ``Data.Monoid.<>`` > ``Data.List.++``
  - and so on...

- For executing subprocesses, use only the functions exported
  from `Purebred.System.Process`.  This is so that output is
  tainted, indicating that it must be sanitised before use.
  (The test suite is excepted from this policy.)


### Differences to Brick

We use Brick heavily, but there are slight differences in Purebred to
an application entirely written using Brick widgets only:

- Keybindings are customizable: Purebred has abstracted the
  Keybindings from widget specific to application specific. When a new
  keystroke is passed as a `VtyEvent`, Purebred checks if a handler is
  registered otherwise it falls back to the default event handler for
  the which in focus. For example, editors which handle input mostly
  fallback to the widgets event handling, since we don't want to
  create an event handler for every input character on your keyboard.

- Actions are composable: at least for the most. The `UI.Actions` tie
  into the customizable keybindings and allow users to compose actions
  for a widget in focus until the UI is repainted. One Keybinding can
  perform one or more chained `Action`s. In order to work with moving
  focus to other widgets, we use PhantomTypes to avoid registering
  Keybindings for which no `Action` "matches".

### Style

- HLint is your friend.  But not always.  If you want to suppress a
  hint (e.g.  suppressing "Avoid lambda" for consistent and
  refactoring-friendly lens definitoions), be sure to include an
  explicit type annotation so that it will play nice with
  ``OverloadedStrings``.

    {-# ANN module ("HLint: ignore Avoid lambda" :: String) #-}

## Using Nix as a development environment

The `nix develop .#shell-with-icu` command will give you a
development environment in which package dependencies for `purebred`
and `purebred-icu` are installed. From there a typical compile/run
session could look like this:

    # clone purebred-icu as well into an adjacent directory to purebred
    # and make cabal aware of purebred *and* purebred-icu necessary to build
    echo "packages: .,../purebred-icu" > cabal.project.local

    # install purebred and the purebred-icu plugin
    $ cabal --enable-nix new-install --overwrite-policy=always exe:purebred lib:purebred-icu

    # run purebred
    $ ~/.cabal/bin/purebred

    # run only acceptance tests containing 'user can abort'
    PATH=~/.cabal/bin:$PATH cabal --enable-nix test --show-details=streaming --test-option='-p /user can abort/' uat

Legacy nix is also supported, check the `default.nix` file.
