== NAME

purebred - A terminal based mail user agent based on notmuch

== SYNOPSIS

purebred [--database DATABASE]
         [--search SEARCH-TERM]
         [--debug FILE]
         [-v|--version]

== Description

Purebred is a powerful text based program for reading and sending
email. It uses the notmuch database for finding and managing email.

== UI

=== How do I change labels?

Labels a.k.a. tags on mails and threads are changed by using a special syntax.

|===
|Syntax | Operation

|=
|Remove all tags

|+tag
|Add `tag` to thread or mail

|-tag
|Remove `tag` to thread or mail
|===

Thus for example, removing all existing tags, and archiving a mail you
would type the following in the editor in Purebred:

[source]
----
= +archive
----

== Configuration
=== What functions can I use to customize the configuration

Purebreds configuration is a nested data structure. In order to
navigate it we export functions based on the <<lens>> package. The best way to
find what to use is to browse the Haddock documentation.

.Example configuration using lens functions to customize Purebred
:sourcedir: ../../configs
[source,haskell]
----
include::{sourcedir}/purebred.hs[lines=61..69]

== UI

=== What view and widget is focused?

A Purebred view consists of many widgets (e.g. a list, a status bar
and an input field). A widget can receive focus and input. Views and
widgets have unique identifiers in Purebred.

Purebred shows the view name and the widget name in the lower right
hand side of the status bar.

== Keybindings

Keybindings are composite functions performing a dedicated action when
a key is pressed.

.Example keybinding setting labels and untoggling any toggled list items
[source,haskell]
----
include::{sourcedir}/purebred.hs[lines=39..44]
----

=== How Purebred handles keys

All bindings are stored in a list and looked up based on a key
event. A pressed key is then matched against the list of bindings. A
match makes Purebred to run the action. If no key matches, Purebred
falls back to the default key handler of the used widget. Falling back
to the default key handling for Brick widgets provides the convenience
that we do not need to register handlers for each possible key in a
text editor widget.

=== Figuring out where to change keybindings
In order to change keybindings, you need to find out:

. the view the widget is in, and
. the widget name, and
. the key event created by the low-level vty framework (see
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vty[Graphics.Vty.Input.Events] on
https://hackage.haskell.org)

=== How to change a keybinding

Creating a new keybinding is easy, by merging the default list of key
bindings with your preferred list of key bindings.

For example, if you want to change labels on your mail by pressing the
kbd:[a] key, you create a new list of keybindings for the
`'ListOfThreads` widget.

.Example shows keybindings and the main config function to overwrite them
[source,haskell]
----
import Purebred

myMailKeybindings :: [Keybinding 'ViewMail 'ScrollingMailView]    -- <1>
myMailKeybindings =
    [ Keybinding (EvKey (KChar 'a') []) (setTags [RemoveTag "inbox", AddTag "archive"]  -- <2>
                                         `chain` continue)  -- <3>
    ]

-- Tweak the default configuration before starting Purebred
main :: IO ()
main = purebred $ tweak defaultConfig where
  tweak = over (confMailView . mvKeybindings) (`union` myMailKeybindings)  -- <4>

----
<1> The type indicates that this list holds key bindings for the
`ViewMail` view and the `ScrollingMailView` widget.
<2> The keybinding starts by calling the `setTags` action, removing
and adding labels.
<3> Every keybinding will have to end with a Brick event loop
action. The `continue` action continues the event loop and therefore
Purebred.
<4> For the custom key bindings to take effect, register them when
calling `purebred`. We rely heavily on the use
of <<lens>> functions to
overwrite the default keybindings by `union` the default list with our
custom list.


== Keybinding Reference

Bindings are registered for a widget and a view in Purebred. This
allows re-usability of widgets between different views.

The following sections lists the view names, their respective widgets
and their registered keybindings.
